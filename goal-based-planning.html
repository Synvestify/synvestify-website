        <h1>What Is Goal-Based Investing?</h1>
        <p>We all have so many things we want to achieve in the future. This can be buying a car, a home, going for a trip, planning for a peaceful retirement, etc. So it is easy to feel overwhelmed and sometimes worry about how you will achieve all your goals.</p>
        <p>This is where goal-based investing helps. Goal-based investing is all about identifying your financial goals, setting a timeline for each one of them, 
            and investing for them regularly to be able to reach them. So essentially, you give all your dreams and financial goals a structure.</p>
        
        <h2>Benefits Of Goal-Based Investing</h2>
        <p><strong>1. You Can Identify Accurate Amount To Fulfil Your Financial Goal</strong></p>
        <p>When you do goal-based investing, you will list down the goal you want to achieve, by when you want to achieve it, and the money you will need for it. And while you do it, you will consider the current cost of achieving that goal and increase in its price.
            For instance, let’s assume you want to plan higher education for your child 10 years away. 
            Currently, it costs Rs. 10 lakh. When you plan for it, you will calculate how much it will cost in the future after factoring in the inflation. 
            So, assuming an average inflation rate of 8% in education, it will cost nearly Rs. 21.6 lakh in 10 years. Now you know how much money you will need for this goal</p>
            
        <p><strong>2.Financial Goals Help You Pick Right Investment Products</strong></p>
        <p>When you know the amount you will need for a goal and know the time you have to accumulate that corpus, you can effectively build your investment strategy. You can pick from asset classes like equity, debt, gold, etc., as per your investment horizon and financial goals.
           
            <p><strong>3. Financial Goals Help You Rebalance Your Portfolio</strong></p>
            <p>When all investments are linked to financial goals, it helps you review and rebalance your portfolio at correct intervals. And also enables you to adopt the appropriate asset allocation strategy.
             For instance, when you approach a long-term goal like retirement, you need to gradually reduce your allocation from Equity and increase allocation to fixed-income products. </p>

             <p><strong>4. Financial Goals Help You Avoid Debt Trap</strong></p>
             <p>If you do not clearly define your goals and do not invest in them, the chances are that you will not have enough money when the time comes. In such a situation, you might be forced to take a loan. The loan will help you achieve the goal at that point. However, you can end up in a debt trap.
                Therefore, it is essential to stay clear of taking loans as much as possible. Take the goal-based investing approach and you will never need to take a loan in desperation</p>
           
            <p><strong>5. Financial Goals Help You Maintain Fiscal Discipline</strong></p>
           <P> Investing without goals is a less disciplined way of investing. Many investors who do not have a goal in mind eventually stop investing due to some distraction or random reason.
            But if you have specific goals to achieve, you are more likely to stay the course. Because you know that you will never reach your goal if you stop your investments. This clarity on the cost of not investing can be a significant driver to continue investing.
            This is a massive advantage because keeping your emotions at bay is as important as picking the right investment products in investing.</P>
       <p><strong>Bottomline</strong></p>
       <p>Mapping out all your needs gives you a clear picture of your finances. 
        Goal-based investing helps you answer important questions like how much to invest, where to invest, and when to start investing. 
        Moreover, it also gives you a purpose to stay invested. And helps you fight your biggest enemy – Your impulsiveness.</p>
